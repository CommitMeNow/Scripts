# Scripts
Just misc productivity scripts. 


RemoveLightHouseDelegations.ps1
    The script will accept a list of subscription ids as input at the command line (separated by commas), OR, a text file with a list of subscription IDs within it. 
    For each subscription, it reads the delegations and outputs on the screen, then asks if you want to remove them.
